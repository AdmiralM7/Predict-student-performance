# Predicting Student's Scores Using Linear Regression


## The goal of the project:
The purpose of this project is to predict the final score of students based on various factors such as study hours, number of private classes, parent's education level, absence rate, etc.

In this project, you will get to know the steps of data cleaning, feature analysis, building a linear regression model and evaluating it.

## Dataset:
For this project, we use the student performance dataset available in the UCI repository:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

This dataset contains information about students, their academic performance and factors related to their teaching and learning.

# Project tasks:

* ### Data exploration:
  
Load the data and check variables such as study hours, previous grades, number of private classes, parent's education level, absence rate, etc.

Analyze data using box plots, scatter plots, and histograms. 

Check the correlation between different characteristics and student's final score using correlation charts and heatmap.

* ### Data preprocessing:
  
Manage missing data, remove irrelevant data or noisy data.

Convert data categories (such as gender, parent's education level) to numbers using label encoding.

Scale attributes such as hours of study or number of absences.

* ### Select features:
  
Use statistical analysis and data visualization to determine the variables that have the greatest impact on students' final scores.

Check the relationship between these variables and students' grades using scatter charts.

* ### Build a linear regression model:
  
Divide the data into two parts, training and testing.

Build a linear regression model using the training data and train it.

Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data.

* ### Model evaluation:
  
Use evaluation metrics such as mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

Evaluate model accuracy.

* ### Cross Validation:
  
Use k-fold cross-validation to make sure your model performs well when faced with new data.
